Asyncronous architecture also called non bloking architecture.

Node application is works based on Asyncronous architecture which means.

    For example:
        Imagine you go to a resturant the waiter comes to a table takes the order and gives it to the kitchen
        Then they move onto serve another table while the chef is prepearing your meal 
        So the same person can serve many different table they dont have to wait for the chef to cook one meal before they serve another table.

    Here:
        The waiter is like a thread allocated to handle a request
        So a single thread is used to handle multiple requests in contrast to non-blocking or Asyncronous,
        We have Bloking or Syncronous architecture.
